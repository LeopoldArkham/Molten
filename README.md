# Molten
## [WIP] Molten - Style-preserving TOML parser.

Molten is (will be) a fully lossles TOML parser with support for insretions, deletions, and editing of all items; It currently parses
and reproduces complex documents correctly.

These days I'm reworking some of the parser internals which are a bit messy, then on to error management and the actual API.
